## Introduction:

This Employee-HR Survey Analysis dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of employee sentiment and satisfaction across the organization. 

The survey responses have been analyzed to identify overall sentiment levels, departmental performance, and specific areas of agreement and disagreement among employees. By combining sentiment distribution, key performance indicators, and question-level insights, the dashboard highlights both the strengths driving positive engagement and the challenges that require targeted HR interventions.


## Key Metrics:

- What is the overall employee sentiment (positive vs negative)?

- How satisfied are employees across different departments?

- Which department has the highest satisfaction and which has the lowest?

- What questions do employees strongly agree with?

- What questions do employees strongly disagree with?

- How are responses distributed across staff and completeness?

- Which departments contribute the most to positive vs negative feedback?

- Where should leadership focus improvement efforts?


## Skills and Concepts Demonstrated:


- Data Cleaning & Preparation (handling complete/incomplete survey responses).

- Sentiment Analysis (positive, neutral, negative categorization).

- KPI Metrics (Net Satisfaction Score, sentiment %, total responses).

- Data Visualization (bar charts, pie chart, KPI cards, departmental sentiment distribution).

- Comparative Analysis (Top vs Bottom departments, agreed vs disagreed questions).

- Dashboard Design Principles (highlighting key insights for decision-making).

- Storytelling with Data (clear focus on employee satisfaction drivers and pain points).

## Analysis:

- Positive sentiment is high (74.5%), with negative at 21.9%.

- Net Satisfaction Score is 52.6%, showing mixed satisfaction levels.

- Emergency Management (86%) is the strongest department, while the Sheriff’s Department (50%) is the weakest.

- Employees agree most with clarity of expectations, inclusivity, and mission alignment.

- Employees disagree most with recognition, accountability, and workplace friendships.

- Some departments have strong positive engagement, while others contribute disproportionately to negative sentiment.

## Conclusion:

The dashboard reveals a generally positive employee outlook, but with clear weaknesses around recognition, accountability, and workplace relationships. Departmental disparities suggest inconsistent employee experiences across the organization.


## Recommendations:

- Employee Recognition – Introduce structured recognition and praise programs.

- Supervisor Training – Equip supervisors with tools to fairly manage accountability.

- Workplace Bonding – Create opportunities for building stronger work relationships.

- Departmental Focus – Prioritize interventions in the Sheriff’s Department.

- Sustain Strengths – Continue supporting clarity, inclusivity, and mission-driven culture.

- Regular Tracking – Use recurring surveys and dashboards to monitor changes.
